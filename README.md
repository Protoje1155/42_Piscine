# 42 Piscine - Shell and Basic C Programming
In this repository, you'll find projects and tasks completed during my time at the piscine at 42 School, focusing on shell scripting and basic C programming.

## Shell
The shell projects introduced me to the basics of working in the terminal. From simple commands to file navigation, I gained knowledge on how to effectively orient myself in the terminal. This included using commands for file navigation, finding files, and working with directories.

## Basic C Programming
The introduction to C programming gave me a solid understanding of its basics. I learned about variables, data types, if statements, loops, and basic memory usage. Through practical exercises, I improved my skills in writing simple C programs.
